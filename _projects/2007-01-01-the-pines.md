<p>A modern contemporary property constructed in a beautiful slyvan plot. Due to difficulty 
planning restrictions the property was designed and constructed with a 1600sqft basement which housed the kitchen 
family room, guest bedroom suite, utility and plant rooms.</p>  

<p>Natural light serviced the basement rooms via a 750sqft light well, which led to a further sunken garden.  
The property also included vaulted ceilings to the drawing room, bifold doors to drawing room and master bedroom suite 
and a gym.</p>
