<p>Ferry Cottage is an outstanding detached property standing on the banks of the river Thames in Shiplake. The property was constructed to replace the original ferrymanâ€™s cottage, which unfortunately was destroyed by flooding in 2014.</p>
<p>Due to the close proximity to the river, ground soil conditions and access restrictions, this build was extremely challenging. The new build property draws on design characteristics from the original dwelling, mixed with the traditional Jamie Smith Estates style.</p>
<p>Key features include detailed brickwork arches and plinths, box and splayed bay windows, decorative timber detailing and balustrade. Jamie Smith Estates achieved Highly Commended status at the 2016 Premier Guarantee excellence awards for this project.</p>
