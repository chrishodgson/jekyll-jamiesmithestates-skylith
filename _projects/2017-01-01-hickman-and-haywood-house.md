<p>Two new build properties, constructed in the traditional late Victorian style, typical to Henley-on-Thames. Situated on one of Henley’s prime residential roads, the properties are in a great location to take advantage of all Henley’s amenities including the river and the train station.</p>
<p>Built in the customary Jamie Smith Estates style, the properties have many interesting features, including detailed Flemish bond brickwork, bay windows, decorative porches and the signature Jamie Smith Estates barge boards. An extra special feature of these two properties are the gargoyle finial detail.</p>
<p>Jamie Smith Estates received a nominations for the Premier Guarantee and LABC building</p>
